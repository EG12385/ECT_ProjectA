<h3><u><strong>Hidden SSID</strong></u></h3><br>
<p>A hidden SSID can prevent public visibility of your corporate SSID.  Hidden SSID's require a manual creation of a wireless profile in order for the</p>
<p>wireless client to initiate association.  Although packet sniffers can detect SSID names from other probe requests and association frames, disabling</p>
<p>SSID broadcasts can dissuade many would-be attackers from trying to gain access.</p>
<p>Shown below Figure 1 is a standard non hidden SSID beacon frame, the AP will send this out for each of the SSIDs that it is broadcasting out.</p>

  <br>
  <p>A hidden SSID will not broadcast the beacon frames - clients will have to know the SSID name to associate. Figure 2 is an iPhone broadcasting a</p>
  <p>request to see if the SSID "Test" is available in the area.</p>
